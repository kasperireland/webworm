NexusBytes will begin transferring all the infrastructure from Burger King over to NexusBytes.<br>We heard from Nahian, CEO of NexusBytes, just last night. He told us "It's finally happening, we're acquiring our favorite fast food place. Their website is too damn slow and their machines are old and are falling apart. We're moving them to our Miami Datacenter. Their website will run on our new blazing fast DirectAdmin web hosting. Their burgers will no longer contain artificial meat and will be powered by NVMe Drives, with DDR4 Buns and AMD Ryzen Sauce. I cannot express my excitement. Burger King, here we come."</p>
<p>Nahian made it very clear that Burger King's website and machines would be much faster with the power of NVMe Burger Meat &amp; a DirectAdmin-powered website.</p>

    EIG official statement:
  </p>

  <p>
    On July 2nd, 4:20AM and 69 Seconds, "EIG" and "Name Hero, LLC." entered into a definitive agreement under which EIG will acquire NameHero.<br>As with all important business decisions, we promise to work closely with our clients, partners,
<br>and employees to make the integration process as seamless as possible. EIG will&nbsp;begin transferring all the infrastructure from NameHero over to HostGator.<br>We do not&nbsp;expect this to interrupt existing client services, however, your website will probably go down for a few days or something. Not our fault tho.
  </p>

  <p>
    All existing services will have their prices kept at where they are for 48 hours, however, after this 48 hour period, all prices will increase by approximately 598%. You may be required to pay a $1,000 transfer fee, to account for the time of us transferring all of your data to HostGator.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thank you for understanding, we look forward to continue to work with NameHero.
