Paul from Blesta promised that every user in the Blesta Discord Community would receive $1 Million from him.</p><p>Since the acquisition of Blesta was completed, by WebPros, Blesta Owned Licenses were discontinued and Monthly Licenses were bumped up in price by 250%, each having active client limits of at least 250.</p><p>Blesta is now offering a migration tool, to migrate from Blesta to WHMCS, as Blesta will be getting merged with WHMCS in November. For every 10 seconds spent using this migration tool, a $5 invoice will be created. That is, if you spend 250 seconds using the migration tool, you would owe $1,250 to WebPros. WebPros was recently asked why there was a fee for such a thing, here is what they had to say:</p><p>We at WebPros only make quality software. This is why, for users which are using our beautiful migration tool, an invoice will be created, as you are using our precious well-developed high quality industry-leading feature-rich modern cross-compatible software for your own use. Failure to pay this invoice within 2 minutes will result in a 50% increase of the invoice price, because you chose to ignore a very clear notification stating you had an overdue invoice.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 10, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://webworm.crabdance.com/authors/gitpearcom/" class="invert" rel="author">CEO OF EIG</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://webworm.crabdance.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://webworm.crabdance.com/whmcs-discontinues-monthly-licenses.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> WHMCS Discontinues Monthly Licenses</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-07-02T13:38" class="feed__date">July 2, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://webworm.crabdance.com/eig-announces-acquisition-of-namehero.html" class="invert">EIG Announces Acquisition of NameHero</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Source available on <a href="https://gitpear.com/kasper/webworm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GitPear</span></a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://webworm.crabdance.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
